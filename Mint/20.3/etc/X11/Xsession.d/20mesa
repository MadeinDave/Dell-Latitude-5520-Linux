# In Mesa 20.0, a new OpenGL driver, Iris, is promoted to be the default for Gen8+. 
# Certain applications run faster with it.
# You may disable it and revert to use the old i965 driver by setting the MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=i965 environment variable before starting any OpenGL 
# application. 
# This setting does not affect Vulkan applications.
